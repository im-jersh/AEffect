The vote will come after years of false starts and bitter disappointments for the Obama administration on cybersecurity legislation. The cybersecurity bill, similar to a measure approved overwhelmingly by the Senate Intelligence Committee, would be Congress’s most aggressive response yet to a burst of computer attacks that helped sink a major motion picture release by Sony Pictures Entertainment, exposed the credit card numbers of tens of thousands of Target customers and compromised the personal records of millions of people who did business with the health insurer Anthem. The House Intelligence Committee passed the bill unanimously last month. The complex issue of policing the nation’s computer networks — which, like much of President Obama’s agenda, has been mired in partisan bickering — has more support both from Republicans, who once expressed concerns for the private sector, and from privacy advocates in light of the recent breaches. We expect a big bipartisan vote, said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who helped negotiate the bill with Republicans and the White House.", "emotion" : "happy"], ["headline" : "Vatican confirms pope will stop in Cuba stop en route to US", "date" : "2015-04-22", "author" : "The ASSOCIATED PRESS", "featuredImage" : "pope.png", "story" : "Pope Francis will visit Cuba before arriving in the United States in the last week of September, the Vatican said Wednesday.

Francis has been credited with helping the United States and Cuba reach their historic rapprochement by writing to the leaders of both countries and having the Vatican host their delegations for the final negotiations. Francis' visit to Cuba would be a way for him to push the process forward. He is scheduled to visit three U.S. cities starting around Sept. 23. He will address Congress and meet with President Barack Obama at the White House in Washington, address the United Nations in New York and attend a church rally for families in Philadelphia. Francis will become the third pope to visit Cuba. In 1998, St. John Paul II said during his visit that Cuba should open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba. Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI followed up with a 2012 trip during which he voiced the Vatican's long-standing position that the U.S. embargo was unjust and only hurt the most vulnerable on the island.

Prices nationally climbed a seasonally-adjusted 3.7 percent in March from 12 months earlier, real estate data firm Zillow said Wednesday. The influx of tech money fueled San Francisco rents up 14.8 percent, while nearby San Jose jumped 12.3 percent. Rents average more than $3,000 a month in these areas. That's roughly $600 more than rent in the Los Angeles area, $800 more than metro New York City, and $1,000 more than the Washington, D.C. area. Prices are also climbing in cities without the same hype from startups and venture capital. Rents rose more than 8.5 percent over the past year in Denver, Louisville, Kansas City and Nashville, among other metro areas. In many cases, demand for apartments and rentals have outstripped the available supply of rental homes and apartments, causing prices to rise. But other major cities are seeing a glut of rental properties. Prices have fallen over the past year in six of the United States' 100 largest metro areas, including Chicago, Minneapolis, New Orleans and Rochester, New York. More Americans have shifted to renting in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the housing bust, which caused an avalanche of foreclosures that depressed prices through 2012. At the end of last year, 36 percent of Americans rented. That's up from 31 percent before the Great Recession, according to the Census Bureau.", "emotion" : "surprise"]]

The fast-food giant said that diluted earnings per share for the first quarter plunged 31 percent from a year earlier, to $0.84, far below the $1.06 a share forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 11 percent from a year earlier, to $5.96 billion, compared with analyst forecasts of $6 billion.The results, the first under McDonald’s new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, underscore the huge challenges the restaurant chain faces as it seeks to reverse several years of lackluster sales. McDonald’s has been increasingly usurped by the likes of Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera, which have grown rapidly by catering to consumer tastes for customization, speed and higher-quality ingredients. Since taking the helm at McDonald’s in March, Mr. Eaterbrook has unleashed a flurry of changes to get the chain back in the game, simplifying offerings at its roughly 14,000 restaurants across the country, introducing premium sirloin burgers and promising to limit the use of antibiotics in chicken. Responding to a tighter job market and to labor campaigns, Mr. Easterbrook has also moved to raise the pay of workers at the 1,500 outlets it directly operates in the United States to at least $1 above the local legal minimum wage. The decision, however, does not affect the bulk of McDonald’s stores — about 12,500, which are run by franchisees and employ 750,000 workers nationwide. The results reported on Wednesday show that the United States market remains difficult for McDonald’s. Comparable sales fell 2.6 percent, and the chain attributed this to product and promotional offers’ not overcoming competitive pressures. Operating income in the home market dipped 11 percent because of weak sales, as well as the costs of restructuring and closing underperforming restaurants. McDonald’s has also struggled overseas, battling supply issues and a food safety sandal in Asia, as well as the lingering effects of delays at West Coast ports that held up shipments of potatoes this year. The chain said comparable sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell 8.3 percent, weighed down by widespread “consumer perception issues in Japan, and sales in Europe fell 0.6 percent. “As the world’s leading restaurant company, we are evolving to be more responsive to today’s customer, Mr. Easterbrook said in a statement. “McDonald’s management team is keenly focused on acting more quickly to better address today’s consumer needs, expectations and the competitive marketplace.", "emotion" : "sadness"]]

BROAD", "featuredImage" : "atom.png", "story" : "When diplomats at the Iran talks in Switzerland pummeled Department of Energy scientists with difficult technical questions — like how to keep Iran’s nuclear plants open but ensure that the country was still a year away from building a bomb — the scientists at times turned to a secret replica of Iran’s nuclear facilities built deep in the forests of Tennessee. There inside a gleaming plant at the Oak Ridge nuclear reservation were giant centrifuges — some surrendered more than a decade ago by Libya, others built since — that helped the scientists come up with what they told President Obama were the “best reasonable estimates of Iran’s real-life ability to race for a weapon under different scenarios. “We know a lot more about Iranian centrifuges than we would otherwise, said a senior nuclear specialist familiar with the forested site and its covert operations. The classified replica is but one part of an extensive crash program within the nation’s nine atomic laboratories — Oak Ridge, Los Alamos and Livermore among them — to block Iran’s nuclear progress. As the next round of talks begins on Wednesday in Vienna, the secretive effort remains a technological obsession for thousands of lab employees living the Manhattan Project in reverse. Instead of building a bomb, as their predecessors did in a race to end World War II, they are trying to stop one. Ernest J. Moniz, the nuclear scientist and secretary of energy, who oversees the atomic labs, said in an interview that as the Obama administration sought technical solutions at the talks, diplomats would have been stumbling in the dark “if we didn’t have this capability nurtured over many decades. Although Mr. Moniz would not discuss the secret plant at Oak Ridge, parts of which date to the American and Israeli program to launch cyberattacks on Iran’s Natanz enrichment plant, he said more generally that the atomic labs give the United States “the capacity to carry through in one of the most complex arms-control efforts in history. It has also changed the labs. In the bomb-making days, the scientists largely kept to their well-guarded posts. But anyone traveling to the Iran talks over the past year and a half in Vienna and Lausanne, Switzerland, saw the Energy Department experts working hard as the negotiations proceeded, and heading out to dinner after long days of talks. It was over one of those dinners in Vienna last summer that several of the experts began wondering how they might find a face-saving way for Iran to convert its deep-underground enrichment plant at Fordo, a covert site exposed by the United States five years ago, into a research center. That would enable Iran to say the site was still open, and the United States could declare it was no longer a threat. “The question was what kind of experiment you can do deep underground, recalled a participant in the dinner. By the time coffee came around, the kernel of an idea had developed, and it subsequently became a central part of the understanding with Iran that Secretary of State John Kerry and Mr. Moniz announced this month. Under the preliminary accord, Fordo would become a research center, but not for any element that could potentially be used in nuclear weapons. Sometimes, during negotiations in Switzerland, a member of the scientific team would dump a bowl of chocolates on the table and rearrange them to show the Iranians how a proposed site rearrangement might work. “It was a visual way, an official said, “to get past the language barrier. But much of the work was done back at the labs, where specialists who had become accustomed to more 9-to-5 days found themselves on call seven days a week, around the clock, answering questions from negotiators and, at times, backing up the answers with calculations and computer modeling. A senior official of the National Nuclear Security Administration, Kevin Veal, who has been along for every negotiating session, would send questions back to the laboratories, hoping to separate good ideas from bad. “It’s what our people love to do, said Thom Mason, the director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. “It can be very rewarding. Given the stakes in the sensitive negotiations, the labs would check and recheck one another, making sure the answers held up. The natural rivalries among the labs sometimes worked to the negotiators’ advantage: Los Alamos National Laboratory, in the mountains of New Mexico, the birthplace of the bomb, was happy to find flaws in calculations done elsewhere, and vice versa.", "emotion" : "worried"], ["headline" : "Freddie Gray in Baltimore: Another City, Another Death in the Public Eye", "date" : "2015-04-21", "author" : "SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and RON NIXON", "featuredImage" : "baltimore.png", "story" : "In life, friends say, Freddie Gray was an easygoing, slender young man who liked girls and partying here in Sandtown, a section of west Baltimore pocked by boarded-up rowhouses and known to the police for drug dealing and crime. In death, Mr. Gray, 25, has become the latest symbol in the running national debate over police treatment of black men — all the more searing, people here say, in a city where the mayor and police commissioner are black. Questions are swirling around just what happened to Mr. Gray, who died here Sunday — a week after he was chased and restrained by police officers, and suffered a spine injury, which later killed him, in their custody. The police say they have no evidence that their officers used force. A lawyer for Mr. Gray’s family accuses the department of a cover-up, and on Tuesday the Justice Department opened a civil rights inquiry into his death. But as protests continued Tuesday night — with hundreds of angry residents, led by a prominent pastor and Mr. Gray’s grieving family, chanting and marching in the streets — the death has also fueled debate on whether African-American leadership here can better handle accusations of police brutality than cities like Ferguson, Mo., and North Charleston, S.C., with their white-dominated governments. “Unlike other places where incidents like this have happened, they understand what it means to be black in America, said City Councilman Brandon Scott, an ally of Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and a frequent critic of Police Commissioner Anthony Batts. “They understand how something like this can get out of hand very quickly, Mr. Scott said. “They understand the community’s frustration more than anyone else. But at the same time they also understand the opposite — they understand the need to have law enforcement in neighborhoods. So it puts them in a bind. This week the mayor and police commissioner have appeared repeatedly in public promising a full and transparent review of Mr. Gray’s death. On Tuesday, the police released the names of six officers who had been suspended with pay, including a lieutenant, a woman and three officers in their 20s who joined the force less than three years ago. Officers canvassed west Baltimore, looking for witnesses. Mr. Batts turned up in Mr. Gray’s neighborhood, chatting with residents and shaking hands. And Ms. Rawlings-Blake said in an interview that she had asked Gov. Larry Hogan for help in getting an autopsy on Mr. Gray performed by the state medical examiner made public, even piecemeal, as quickly as possible. The mayor said she supported the Justice Department inquiry. Chanting “Black Lives Matter and “Justice for Freddie, protesters marched Tuesday evening on the block where Mr. Gray was arrested. The Rev. Jamal Bryant asked for a moment of silence. Mr. Gray’s relatives — including his mother, her head shrouded in the hood of a sweatshirt — paused quietly. Mr. Gray’s arrest, which was captured on a cellphone video that shows him being dragged, seemingly limp, into a police van, has revived a debate in this city over police practices. “We have a very challenging history in Baltimore, Ms. Rawlings-Blake said, adding that she had worked hard “to repair a broken relationship between black residents and the police. She called Mr. Gray’s death “a very sad and frustrating setback. Ms. Rawlings-Blake and Mr. Batts had been talking about the problem long before the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August spawned national protests and the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. But the officials’ actions are doing little to assuage angry residents here. Rosa Mobley says she witnessed Mr. Gray’s arrest from her bedroom window, and heard him screaming as the police dragged him into a transport van. “We got this so-called black mayor, but she don’t care nothing about us, Ms. Mobley said as Mr. Batts pulled up in the neighborhood in a black SUV just before noon on Tuesday. “They don’t come around here.

The police in Ghazni Province on Sunday confirmed that four Hazara farmers who had been kidnapped by the Taliban had been found beheaded in Ajristan District. Another six Hazaras from Daikundi Province who had been kidnapped by unknown assailants were also found dead, dumped in Ajristan District, less than a week after their families began searching for them, officials confirmed on Monday. Although the police have not yet recovered the bodies, local reports said they, too, had been beheaded. Beheading is not normally a Taliban tactic, but the insurgents seem to be trying to make an ugly example of the Hazaras, in what is seen by some as a bid for attention. “The Taliban are trying to send out a new message that they are similar in their brutality to ISIS, said Shahgul Rezaye, a Hazara member of Parliament, referring to Islamic State extremists from Iraq and Syria, who have reportedly been trying to recruit supporters in Afghanistan. “They’re trying to show they are as bad as ISIS. In what may prove to be the worst single episode, insurgents stopped a bus in Zabul Province in February, separated out the 31 Hazaras and took them away, releasing those from other ethnic groups. The victims have not been seen or heard from since. Those and other attacks have galvanized the Hazaras. They have staged daily protests in Kabul, and blocked Parliament with demonstrators who stood and held empty bowls, to signify their unsuccessful effort to beg the government for help. A logo with the number 31 has become ubiquitous in displays here. Poetry and street theater are regular features at their protest tents, pitched in three places around Kabul and drawing frequent coverage on local television stations.", "emotion" : "worried"]]

Appearing in court in London dressed in a canary yellow sweatshirt and white track suit pants, the trader, Navinder Singh Sarao, a British national, sat behind a glass wall looking dazed by the proceedings around him. His defense lawyer, Joel Smith, said that the arrest had come as a “bolt out of the blue and that he had struggled to connect with any of his client’s family or friends. He eventually contacted Mr. Sarao’s father, but said he could not deduce much from the patchy conversation. Mr. Sarao lives with his parents and down the road from his brother. He was born and educated in Britain and attended Brunel University London. The judge set bail at more than 5 million pounds with several conditions. The Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the United States have filed criminal and civil charges against Mr. Sarao, alleging wire fraud, commodities fraud, commodities manipulation and spoofing, a form of market manipulation. During the crash in May 2010, the Dow fell nearly 600 points in a matter of minutes, rattling individual investors and institutional investors alike. Regulators have struggled to piece together what happened, offering up various explanations, many of which have been contested. Although the major indexes recovered most of the losses, the event shook investors’ confidence in the markets, and the exchanges and regulators that police them. In the criminal complaint, Mr. Sarao is accused of entering and withdrawing thousands of orders worth tens of millions of dollars on hundreds of trading days, in an attempt to push down the price of futures contracts tied to the value of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, a practice indicated to be spoofing. Once the price fell, Mr. Sarao would buy the contract and reap the profits, according to the criminal complaint. Prosecutors contend that on the day of the flash crash, May 6, Mr. Sarao placed large orders repeatedly over several hours, leaving the market vulnerable to big moves when another big trade came in from an investor in the United States. Mr. Sarao was arrested in London on Tuesday. It was confirmed in court that his passport was seized and he spent the night in custody.", "emotion" : "fear"]]

The warplanes bombed Houthi positions during heavy clashes in Taiz on Wednesday morning, according to a local official in the city. The new airstrikes, combined with reports of continued fighting in other parts of the country, including the southern port city of Aden, dampened hopes that the Saudi announcement would quickly result in a broader cease-fire. Saudi officials said on Tuesday that they were stopping the aerial operation because it had achieved its objectives, including destroying heavy weapons and missiles belonging to Yemeni troops allied with the Houthis. They had faced intensifying international pressure to stop airstrikes that were killing a growing number of civilians. The United Arab Emirates have also carried out airstrikes as part of the campaign, and the United States has contributed logistical and intelligence support. But one of the principal Saudi goals remained unfulfilled: the restoration to power of the exiled Yemeni president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was driven from power by the Houthis. On Tuesday, the Saudis said they retained the right to “counter any military moves by the Houthis or their allies, a possible signal that they intended to continue their military intervention by other means, like financing proxy troops. The name of the Saudi operation was also changed, to “Renewal of Hope from “Decisive Storm. It was unclear whether the strikes represented a resumption of the original operation, but there was little evidence of change in the nature of the combat on Wednesday. In several areas of Taiz, fierce clashes erupted between the Houthis and their allies, on one side, and militiamen loyal to Mr. Hadi on the other, according to Mohamed al-Haj, a member of the local council. The Houthi forces continued their advance, trying to capture a military brigade that declared its loyalty to Mr. Hadi. The warplanes struck the Houthis in the morning. “There are many deaths on both sides, Mr. Haj said. In Aden, where weeks of urban warfare have destroyed neighborhoods and killed hundreds of people, there were exchanges of tank fire between the Houthis and their adversaries, mainly local fighters who favor an independent, southern state, residents said. “The Houthis are still bombing and still sniping people, said one local fighter. “They have not started moving away from Aden. In a statement quoted by Reuters, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, an ally of the Houthis, had welcomed the Saudis’ announcement of a halt to bombing. “We hope that everybody will return to dialogue to solve and treat all the issues, the news agency quoted him as saying.", "emotion" : "anger"]]
