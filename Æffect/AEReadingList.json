Mr. Hussain, for his part, called it a conspiracy to damage his image.<\/p>\n \n \n\n<\/div>\n \n The opposition leader Imran Khan during an anti-government demonstration in Islamabad, Pakistan, last year.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n But in Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest and most volatile city, the accusations were seen as further evidence that the political winds were violently shifting against Mr. Hussain after decades of iron-fisted dominance.<\/p>\n In the last month, the civilian and military authorities, led by the Sindh Rangers paramilitary force, have begun an unparalleled assault on the authority of Mr. Hussain, who has been living in self-imposed exile in London for nearly a quarter-century, and the network of armed street enforcers that underpins his authority in Karachi.<\/p>\n On March 11, Rangers in balaclavas raided Nine Zero, the fortified headquarters of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Mr. Hussein\u2019s party, confiscating weapons and files. One political worker was killed by gunfire during the raid, and several others were taken into custody, some on murder charges.<\/p>\n On the political front, Mr. Hussain has come under attack from the opposition leader Imran Khan<\/a>, who has started an aggressive foray into his electoral heartland. On Friday, in a symbolic challenge, Mr. Khan held a small event just a few hundred yards from Mr. Hussain\u2019s party headquarters.<\/p>\n In London, the British police are continuing to press criminal investigations of Mr. Hussain and his inner circle. On April 1, a senior aide, Muhammad Anwar, was arrested on suspicion of money laundering.<\/p>\n\n Mr. Hussain, who was arrested in connection with the same case last June, underwent further questioning at a London police station on Tuesday. His bail has been extended until July.<\/p>\n Not long ago, any of those shocks would have caused an immediate shutdown of Karachi, a city of 20 million people where Mr. Hussain\u2019s ability to empty the streets at an hour\u2019s notice has long been a sign of his immense influence.<\/p>\n But this past month, life has largely continued as normal. Instead, Muttahida\u2019s militant wing \u2014 organized groups of armed supporters who carry out extortion and intimidation, and are seen as the enforcers of Mr. Hussain\u2019s authority \u2014 has melted off the streets.<\/p>\n The news media, which previously treated the party with caution, has aired criticism of the party. (Among those arrested was a Muttahida supporter charged with the murder of Wali Khan Babar<\/a>, a prominent television journalist who was shot dead in his car in 2011.) And in the city\u2019s political back rooms, senior Muttahida officials have begun to quietly consider the possibility of a new leader \u2014 an unthinkable idea until recently.<\/p>\n \u201cThe fear factor is gone,\u201d said a senior party official who, like several others, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.<\/p>\n But the upheaval has also brought worries of new instability in a city that is awash with armed groups. Noting that Karachi is in a \u201cstate of flux,\u201d the newspaper Dawn warned in an editorial<\/a> this month that \u201cwhen the chips fall, they may not do so without considerable violence.\u201d<\/p>\n The moves against Muttahida are part of a broader effort to stem Karachi\u2019s cycle of political and criminal violence that has left the city prone to Taliban infiltration in recent years. Militants disrupted election campaigning in 2013, leading to a crackdown that has broken several Taliban cells, according to police officials and ethnic Pashtun community leaders.<\/p>\n Now the authorities have turned to the armed wings of the city\u2019s political parties, of which Muttahida is by far the largest.<\/p>\n But few are writing off Mr. Hussain, a wily political player with a long record of survival, just yet.<\/p>\n For much of the 1990s, Mr. Hussain\u2019s supporters waged a street war against the security forces in Karachi, only to ultimately re-emerge stronger than ever.<\/p>\n Since then, he has enjoyed unquestioning support from the city\u2019s mohajir population \u2014 mostly Urdu-speaking families that migrated from India in 1947 \u2014 by playing on their sense of grievance at the hands of local ethnic groups, in the process creating a magnetic cult of personality.<\/p>\n This time, however, the challenges also come from within. Mr. Hussain\u2019s stewardship of the party has become increasingly erratic recently, several officials said.<\/p>\n In addresses to party rallies in Karachi, delivered over the phone from London \u2014 his usual mode of communication with the party faithful \u2014 he frequently appears to be under the influence of alcohol, they said.<\/p>\n During one lengthy tirade on March 30, Mr. Hussain publicly resigned his leadership and urged his followers to take up charity work, only to reappoint himself hours later.<\/p>\n \u201cWe never know if it\u2019s going to be happy hour or sad hour,\u201d said one senior official who privately advocated a change in leadership and spoke on the condition of anonymity.<\/p>\n To many, it seems clear that the Pakistani military, which has a long history of meddling in politics, is trying to engineer a change in leadership. Journalists say that the videotaped accusations from Mr. Mirza, the death-row convict, bore the hallmarks of a military intelligence operation.<\/p>\n In political circles, the army has started to take informal soundings about a possible successor to Mr. Hussain, the same party official said.<\/p>\n \u201cThey want to keep the M.Q.M., but without Altaf or anyone directly associated with violence,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n But experts warn that such a strategy is fraught with danger. \u201cIf the M.Q.M. implodes, what will happen to Karachi?\u201d said Laurent Gayer, author of \u201cOrdered Disorder and the Struggle for the City,\u201d a recent book on Karachi. \u201cIt seems that few people are thinking about the consequences of a militarized, fragmented party.\u201d<\/p>\n In any event, Mr. Gayer said, it is unlikely that Mr. Hussain will be unseated through conventional politics, and so, much hinges on the outcome of the long-running police investigation in London.<\/p>\n Mr. Hussain looked unsteady as he pushed through reporters at the entrance to the London police station on Tuesday. He has said that a large sum of money found at his house \u2014 about $650,000, party officials say \u2014 came from legitimate political donations.<\/p>\n But his circle faces potentially greater peril from a related police investigation into the murder of Imran Farooq<\/a>, a former ally who was stabbed to death outside his London home in 2010. On Monday, the Pakistan interior ministry announced that a suspect in the case had been arrested.<\/p>\n Still, the British police seem mainly interested in two other suspects, both Muttahida supporters, who fled to Pakistan from London just after the killing in 2010.<\/p>\n The police have not brought charges in either case. But just the possibility of a prosecution has visibly destabilized Mr. Hussain\u2019s party and has weakened his grip on Karachi.<\/p>\n For now, though, the most immediate threat is political. The opposition leader Mr. Khan, whose party is close to the military, and Muttahida are running in an important by-election in Karachi on April 23.

But even among Muttahida officials, there is a gnawing worry about what will happen if Mr. Hussain, who long commanded the respect of figures like Mr. Mirza, suddenly loses control.<\/p>\n \u201cThe militants are confused and worried,\u201d another senior party official said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to follow instructions from a man who says one thing in the morning, and another in the afternoon.

He had spent a year away from the game after being suspended for using performance-enhancing drugs. Baseball wanted a longer suspension, but Rodriguez fought and got the ban reduced.

     "content_without_tags":" April 12, 2015 Sports of The Times By WILLIAM C. RHODEN Yankees fans had the first glimpse last week of life without Derek Jeter and life with Alex Rodriguez. Hometown fans generally greet Rodriguez warmly. He had spent a year away from the game after being suspended for using performance-enhancing drugs. Baseball wanted a longer suspension, but Rodriguez fought and got the ban reduced. His return gave fans a reason to be hopeful. While it would be a stretch to say Rodriguez has roared back, he has been more than credible. Even as the Yankees lost four of five games to open the season heading into Sunday\u2019s series finale against the Red Sox, Rodriguez offered a ray of hope. He had seven hits, including a home run, and was batting .278. He even played first base, where he committed an error, but otherwise turned in an encouraging performance. On Sunday, in his first at-bat, Rodriguez drove in three runs with a double. Rodriguez is not the Yankees\u2019 problem this season, and he may even be the team\u2019s salvation. The larger issue is a pitching staff led by Masahiro Tanaka, who was drilled in the season opener, and C. C. Sabathia, who lost his first start as well. The Yankees know what they have in Rodriguez: a baseball prodigy who, at age 39, is better than many players 10 years younger. The reality is that only Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra had more home runs as a Yankee than Rodriguez. I\u2019m fascinated by critics who write that Rodriguez has \u201cruined\u201d his legacy. In whose eyes? Clearly not among the thousands who have applauded Rodriguez for the last few days. Who writes the history? Who determines which legacies are \u201cruined\u201d and which are not? An overwhelmingly white, male baseball establishment that sits in judgment, that\u2019s who. If it were my vote, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens would be in the Hall of Fame effective immediately. In the stats-driven, nostalgia-laced business of baseball, statistics speak for themselves. We keep reading that Alex Rodriguez played us. He didn\u2019t play us. We \u2014 fans, the news media \u2014 played ourselves. Deluded ourselves as baseball continued to lie to itself. Baseball tells us that the wicked witch of performance-enhancing drugs is dead. Right. On Saturday we learned that the Mets\u2019 Jenrry Mejia had tested positive for the steroid stanozolol and would be suspended for 80 games. Earlier this month, we learned that three other players had tested positive for stanozolol. Clearly, they don\u2019t have access to the latest science on performance-enhancing drugs. Yankees Manager Joe Girardi made a sensible and fair-minded point last week when asked about Rodriguez. \u201cWe live in a society that gives people second and third chances \u2014 fourth, fifth,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cLook, as humans we\u2019re going to make mistakes.

I had this conversation in the commissioner\u2019s suite with Bud Selig during the World Series. My argument is that baseball will never have closure on this issue until former baseball commissioners, the current commissioner, team presidents and officials, as well as team owners past and present, testify under oath about who knew what and when. The players have simply been fall guys for a sport that knew exactly what was transpiring and for fans who largely did not care. Let these Yankees begin winning and you will not have enough seats to accommodate the crowd. In terms of Rodriguez\u2019s legacy, he was on the way to becoming one of the greatest shortstops to play the game until he reached the Yankees and, out of deference to Derek Jeter, switched to third base. Rodriguez became one of the best third basemen in the game, and I have little doubt that with time and reps, he could become an All-Star-caliber first baseman and could become an outstanding designated hitter. Rodriguez knows how to play the game \u2014 on and off the field. So far this season, he is saying all the right things. \u201cI love our fans,\u201d he said after the Yankees\u2019 opening-day loss. \u201cWe have a long history here. I think about 2009 and some of the things we accomplished together. I think this is an opportunity to help the team win.\u201d And then added: \u201cThe fans don\u2019t owe me anything.

Athletes in that bygone era were given a wide berth because of their celebrity. Now we look for celebrity deeds and misdeeds to fill an insatiable, eternal news cycle. The Jeter era is over, and fans are right to lament its passing. Jeter was the consummate professional, giving crisp, no-frills interviews that revealed only what he wanted to reveal. Jeter was the image of the clean-cut, unflawed Yankee. Rodriguez is flawed. That, for me, is what makes him one of the most compelling figures in contemporary sports. We learned, among other things, that he liked cigars and played a game of poker now and then. We know that he used steroids and lied about it. He gave the people what they wanted, and baseball what it wanted. Now he is back. Next stop: Willie Mays. Email: wcr@nytimes.com",

It needs to stop.\u201d As he departed the summit meeting where a historic meeting with President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba provided concrete evidence of one of his most significant foreign policy achievements, Mr. Obama faced mounting questions about another goal \u2014 the Iran deal. The framework was forged in Switzerland this month, and American negotiators and allies are working with Iran to finalize an agreement by June 30. \u201cWe\u2019ve got work until the end of June to make sure that we\u2019ve got a document that works,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf, in fact, we\u2019re not satisfied that it cuts off the pathways for Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, then we won\u2019t sign it.\u201d Mr. Obama is facing a double bind over the next two months with the deal pending. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has suggested that his country will not comply with crucial conditions, including unfettered access to nuclear sites. He has insisted that sanctions be lifted immediately after a deal is signed, something the United States has said would not happen. Closer to home, the Republican-led Congress is demanding review power over any agreement, and will begin considering bipartisan legislation next week that would allow them to review the deal, vote to disapprove it and limit Mr. Obama\u2019s ability to waive sanctions. Graphic | A Simple Guide to the Nuclear Negotiations With Iran A guide to help you navigate the talks between Western powers and Tehran. Some Republican critics of the accord, including Mr. McCain, have seized upon the assertions of Iran\u2019s leaders to argue that Mr. Obama is on the brink of ceding too much in the talks. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to me that the supreme leader or a whole bunch of other people are going to try to characterize the deal in a way that protects their political position, but I know what was discussed in arriving at the political agreement,\u201d Mr. Obama said. As for Congress, he said he had talked to Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a sponsor of the review bill, and Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the panel\u2019s senior Democrat, about how to give Congress a voice in the debate. \u201cI want to work with them so that Congress can look at this deal when it\u2019s done,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m concerned about is making sure that we don\u2019t prejudge it,\u201d he added, or allow opponents of the deal to \u201ctry to use a procedural argument essentially to screw up the possibility of a deal.\u201d",

The regulation is being introduced as the Obama administration is taking steps to open up vast new areas of federal waters off the southeast Atlantic Coast to drilling, a decision that has infuriated environmentalists.<\/p>\n The rule is expected to tighten safety requirements on blowout preventers, the industry-standard devices that are the last line of protection to stop explosions in undersea oil and gas wells. The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010, was caused in part when the buckling of a section of drill pipe led to the malfunction of a supposedly fail-safe blowout preventer on a BP well called Macondo.<\/p>\n It will be the third and biggest new drilling-equipment regulation put forth by the Obama administration in response to the disaster. In 2010, the Interior Department announced new regulations on drilling well casings, and in 2012, it announced new regulations on the cementing of wells.<\/p>\n The latest regulation, a result of several years of study, will be imposed on all future offshore drilling<\/a> equipment and will be used by the administration to make the case that it can prevent a BP-like disaster as oil exploration expands in the Atlantic. The Interior Department is also reviewing a proposal from Royal Dutch Shell to drill in the Arctic\u2019s Chukchi Sea, off the coast of Alaska.<\/p>\n \u201cWe\u2019re coming on five years, and we\u2019ve been working tirelessly in the regulation division since it happened,\u201d said Allyson Anderson, associate director of strategic engagement in the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. \u201cWe\u2019ve doubled down on building a culture of safety,\u201d<\/p>\n But environmentalists remained highly skeptical.<\/p>\n \u201cMaking sure the design, operation and maintenance of the blowout preventer is the best it can possibly be is imperative, no question,\u201d said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council and co-author of the book \u201cIn Deep Water,\u201d an investigation of the cause of the spill. \u201cIndustry and government have taken measures over the past five years to reduce some of the risk in what is an inherently dangerous operation at sea.

Between 2009 and 2014, the overall number of oil- and gas-producing wells dropped about 20 percent, and accidents and incidents associated with drilling in the Gulf of Mexico dropped 14 percent.

Members of the Soltan family have said they will appeal the decision, and other defendants are expected to appeal as well.<\/p>\n The verdict is the latest in a long series of similarly harsh sentences handed down at mass trials of dozens or hundreds of defendants accused of participating in violent protests or riots in the aftermath of the military takeover, often based on only police testimony or cursory evidence. Thousands more remain imprisoned without convictions. The sweeping penalties have drawn outraged denunciations from rights groups and milder rebukes from Western diplomats.<\/p>\n But the case of the younger Mr. Soltan, 27, is exceptional because he is an American citizen.<\/p>\n The verdict comes just days after President Obama released hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid<\/a> for Egypt<\/a> that had previously been suspended in response to the military takeover and subsequent repression.<\/p>\n In a statement, the United States State Department said that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the decision and \u201cdeeply concerned about Mr. Soltan\u2019s health and detention.\u201d The statement called for Egypt<\/a> to release Mr. Soltan \u201con humanitarian grounds.\u201d<\/p>\n Tom Malinowski, the State Department\u2019s top human rights official, criticized the sentencing in blunter terms. \u201cUS citizen #Soltan sentenced to life in prison for nothing more than attending a protest,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.<\/p>\n Raised in the Midwest by Egyptian immigrant parents, Mr. Soltan graduated from Ohio State University in 2012 and found a job in Cairo at a petroleum services company. Although his father was a prominent and outspoken member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the younger Mr. Soltan disagreed with the group and criticized Mr. Morsi, said his family and friends. But he has also said he opposed the military\u2019s removal of Mr. Morsi, Egypt\u2019s first fairly elected president, because it was undemocratic.<\/p>\n Mr. Soltan began volunteering as a translator for Western journalists covering the Islamist sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square to protest the takeover. Security forces forcibly broke up the sit-in on Aug. 14, 2013, killing nearly a thousand<\/a>, according to the best estimates provided by Human Rights Watch and others.

     "content_without_tags":" By\u00a0DAVID\u00a0D.\u00a0KIRKPATRICK and\u00a0JARED\u00a0MALSIN April 11, 2015 CAIRO \u2014 An Egyptian court on Saturday sentenced an American citizen, Mohamed Soltan, to life imprisonment for supporting an Islamist protest against the military ouster of President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in the summer of 2013. The presiding judge, Mohammed Nagi Shehata, sentenced more than 35 other defendants in the case to the same penalty and also confirmed death sentences in the same case for about a dozen defendants, including the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s top spiritual guide, Mohamed Badie, 71, as well as Mr. Soltan\u2019s father, Salah Soltan. Gehad el-Haddad, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, was also sentenced to life in prison. Members of the Soltan family have said they will appeal the decision, and other defendants are expected to appeal as well. The verdict is the latest in a long series of similarly harsh sentences handed down at mass trials of dozens or hundreds of defendants accused of participating in violent protests or riots in the aftermath of the military takeover, often based on only police testimony or cursory evidence. Thousands more remain imprisoned without convictions. The sweeping penalties have drawn outraged denunciations from rights groups and milder rebukes from Western diplomats. But the case of the younger Mr. Soltan, 27, is exceptional because he is an American citizen. The verdict comes just days after President Obama released hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid for Egypt that had previously been suspended in response to the military takeover and subsequent repression. In a statement, the United States State Department said that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the decision and \u201cdeeply concerned about Mr. Soltan\u2019s health and detention.\u201d The statement called for Egypt to release Mr. Soltan \u201con humanitarian grounds.\u201d Tom Malinowski, the State Department\u2019s top human rights official, criticized the sentencing in blunter terms. \u201cUS citizen #Soltan sentenced to life in prison for nothing more than attending a protest,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Raised in the Midwest by Egyptian immigrant parents, Mr. Soltan graduated from Ohio State University in 2012 and found a job in Cairo at a petroleum services company. Although his father was a prominent and outspoken member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the younger Mr. Soltan disagreed with the group and criticized Mr. Morsi, said his family and friends. But he has also said he opposed the military\u2019s removal of Mr. Morsi, Egypt\u2019s first fairly elected president, because it was undemocratic. Mr. Soltan began volunteering as a translator for Western journalists covering the Islamist sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square to protest the takeover. Security forces forcibly broke up the sit-in on Aug. 14, 2013, killing nearly a thousand, according to the best estimates provided by Human Rights Watch and others. Mr. Soltan was shot in the arm during the assault on the sit-in, and the police arrested him at his home several days later. He has remained in jail since then. He and the others in the case were reportedly accused of joining a command center at the sit-in that sought to spread chaos across Egypt in defiance of the government. Mr. Soltan has conducted a hunger strike for more than a year to protest his imprisonment, according to his family. In a recent letter to the family that was provided to The New York Times, American diplomats working on the case warned that his hunger strike \u201chas done and continues to do severe, in some cases irreparable, damage to his body\u201d and \u201cis a significant threat to his life.\u201d In a letter smuggled from prison and published on the website of The Times in early 2014, Mr. Soltan recalled volunteering for Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential campaign and appealed to the president for help. \u201cI often get asked sarcastically by judges, officers, and even inmates, \u2018Where is this first world country that takes such pride in defending human rights and freedoms?

The authorities have directed many of the cases involving political activists or the Brotherhood to a special circuit of courts, and Judge Shehata, who issued the verdict against the Soltans, has stood out for his swift and draconian rulings.
